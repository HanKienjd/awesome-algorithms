<p>
Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.
You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.
</p>

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
>Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"</br>Output: "134"

<strong>Example 2:</strong>
>Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"</br>
Output: "533"

<strong>Example 3:</strong>
>Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
</br>
Output: "0"

<strong>Constraints</strong>
- 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104
- num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
- num1 and num2 don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
